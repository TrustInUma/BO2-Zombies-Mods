# Overview
This is a collection of personally created and collected mods I've had on BO2 Zombies for a while. I've updated several of these to work well with each other 
while also adding in new features. I will of course credit the original creators of some of these mods further down. If I miss anyone please let me know, and 
thank you for making such awesome mods!

The following features work on all maps but I haven't had time to test them fully on Origins. All features work in Solo, Custom Games, and Servers:

# Global Features
- Gobblegum System
- Widow's Wine
- AATs (Thunderwall, Turned, Blast Furnace, etc.)
- Death Machine Powerup (Upgraded Ray Gun Mark 2)
- Solo Easter Eggs
- Sliding
- Shareable Box Weapons
- 150 Base Health (3 Hit Down)

# Map-Specific Features
# TranZit
  - Fast-Travel System
  - Fire Sale Powerup
  - Tombstone Solo Availability And Revamp (if you have Quick Revive, Tombstone powerup drops immediately on downing)
  - Revamped Bus System
    - The Bus can now be paid to move to the next location (500 points)
    - HUD now shows Bus location and time left before moving
    - Paying the Bus enough times grants the player a Golden Bus Pass (all Bus purchases become free)
    - Using the Golden Bus Pass enough times grants the Bus a huge speed increase
  - Denizen Easter Egg
    - Killing enough Denizens with Electric Traps, Turrets, and Bowie Knife/Galvaknuckles permanently disables them
  - Electric Traps and Turrets no longer damage players. Electric Traps now last longer and kill enemies within a certain radius
  - All weapons and equipment available in the Mystery Box
  - Wall weapons available in Town
  - Craftable parts are now named on the HUD
  - Shield Health Bar on HUD

# Die Rise
  - Fast-Travel System
  - Fire Sale Powerup
  - Buddha Room Easter Egg Step Glitch Fix (now works with any melee weapon)
  - Craftable parts are now named on the HUD

# Buried
  - Super Easter Egg Revamp
    - Upon completing any side of the main easter egg, the next round transition will trigger the endgame rewards
    - This means you DO NOT need to have the Tranzit or Die Rise easter eggs previously done. Simply doing Buried's easter egg will give you the
      rewards for the side you completed (Richtofen or Maxis)
    - Sharpshooter, Wisp, and Bell steps can now be done solo
    - Bell step will now notify players the correct bell to interact with
  - Craftable parts are now named on the HUD

# Mob of the Dead
  - Afterlife Now Works Correctly On Custom Games/Dedicated Servers (if the number of players in the match is equal to 1, Afterlife gives 3 lives just like in Solo)
  - All Plane Parts Now Shared In Custom Games/Dedicated Servers (same as in Solo)
  - Shield Health Bar on HUD

# Origins
  - TBA
